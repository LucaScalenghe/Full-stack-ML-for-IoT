# Full-stack-ML-for-IoT
For every part you have a full description inside the specific folder, here you have a condensed version of the topics:
Exercise 1: Voice Activity Detection Optimization & Deployment
Notebook to optimize the hyper-parameters for a VAD application obtaining accuracy on a vad-dataset > 98% and average latency < 9ms.
Continuously records audio and stores it if speech is detected using the optimized method.

Exercise 2: Memory-constrained Timeseries Processing
Memory-constrained battery monitoring system that logs how many seconds the power was plugged in the past 24 hours sendind data to Redis.
Script should be run from CLI with Redis Cloud host, port, user, password as input arguments.
Explain the setup of the timeseries and calculation for setting the retention period in the PDF report.

Exercise 3: Training & Deployment of a "Go/Stop" Classifier
Develop a REST Server that enables users to retrieve data by calling your API.
Visualize the collected timeseries
